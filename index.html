            Communicate - First, I excel at making complex topics more palatable for customer
            consumption. I start with why and
            I
            treat the sales process more as a learning process for customers to not only understand our solution but
            to
            better comprehend the underlying technology. This
            leads to a better decision making process for the customer, they relax and we begin our trusted advisor
            relationship.

        <p class='cBorder44'>
            for example, in the context of showing a Data governance solution, I tell customers :

            <i style="font-family: CCItalic">‚ÄúYou know ten or so years from now when we are no longer here and there is
                a new technology on the block,
                you are going to want to leave a legacy that makes it easier to transition to the new technology.
                How?
                With our solution You will be able to export all of your hard work and import it into your next
                technology.‚Äù</i>

            Communicate - I focus on my written communication skills. I just finished the book, "smart
            brevity" and i am now applying the principles I learned
            from it. You may see some examples of my writing on my <a href="https://awindest.github.io">portfolio
                website</a>. My presentation style is relaxed and I try to
            be memorable. For example, after a day long technical presentation to the evaluation committee of a US
            federal reserve bank, we were asked, <i style="font-family: CCItalic">
                "where is the next Bill show?"
            </i> Just goes to show you that even bankers can contribute to the fun during a software evaluation. (Yes,
            we won the deal.)

            Curious - An important skill that sets me apart from other candidates is I am intellectually
            curious
            and not only want to learn new things but I thrive on it. I have a genuine interest in this position and
            want
            to learn
            more. I am
            continuously trying to improve my presentation and sales skills.</p>

            For example, the best color to wear on a zoom call is blue. No stripes. Use a pointer or marker on the
            screen to draw your audience's eyes to what you
            want them to focus on. Have your head centered in the middle one-third of the screen and have your camera at
            eye level so you are looking straight at them, not down,
            or to the side or up. These are some of the tidbits that I learned to improve my
            presentation
            skills.</p>

            Problem solver - I enjoy solving problems. even in the best of jobs problems will arise. The ability to
            solve these problems
            correctly and
            efficiently makes for a great employee and I consider myself such a person. Sure, there will be some
            problems that I will need to take to my boss or a fellow
            team mate but I try to solve it first prior to seeking help.

            Leader - I lead. Once i am trained and i have shadowed several other demonstrations, my hand
            will not
            need to be held through every little task and I am
            capable of leading others as well. I am independent and will excel in my role. I possess a great deal of
            motivation; I like being a rock star and I like helping others become rock stars. The more the merrier.

            Work ethic - as I mentioned previously I am driven to work hard. This trait is extremely valuable to the
            team. I don't have any qualms about spending
            the time to get something done. You do what you have to do to generate revenue.

            Plays well with others - not only am I a leader but I work well with a team. I know
            how to listen as much as
            I
            contribute and I take on my share of the workload to make sure we are all moving towards our common goals.

            Humor - I am fortunate to possess a fairly robust sense of humor. Let me tell a few
            stories to
            illustrate.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class='panel'>
        <p class='cBorder44'>I was getting ready to perform a software demonstration at a conference and a coworker was
            introducing me
            to
            a group of about forty people, saying, <i style="font-family: CCItalic">"Bill will login as Lisa and do
                X and then login as George and do Y
                and then login as Robin and do Z."</i>
            I stepped up to the podium and on the spur of the moment, I said, <i style="font-family: CCItalic">"Hi,
                I'm Bill Indest and I suffer
                from a multiple personality disorder."</i>
            Much to my surprise the entire room erupted in laughter.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class='panel'>
        <p class='cBorder44'> Here is another example. We were on an internal team conference call (I wouldn't have said
            this on a customer call) and someone's big
            dog barked deeply and I immediately said,<i style="font-family: CCItalic">"Sorry, that's my wife" </i> and
            everyone cracked
            up. To this day, we reminisce about that call and laugh. And of course my wife knows of my antics.

        <p class='cBorder'> Finally, here are some life rules that I try to follow:<br> <b
